# VSP2023

VSP at Raman Research Institute, summer 2023.

- Worked on two majors projects in the span, the SKA-LOW (150-350MHz) range Log Periodic Dipole Antenna (LPDA) interferometry array, and the Analog + Digital backend for a RedPitaya module for conducting wideband Horn observations for 21cm Galactic Hydrogen emissions.

- LPDA: (MATLAB and Python programs are available for all of the below*)
  -  Python program for Data acquisition out of an Oscilloscope,
  -  Visualizing Solar and Galactic plane transits in the Radio spectrum.  
  -  Two element Interferometry for Solar Radio signals; observation of Fringe pattern. 

*Working on developing a GUI for the same

- RedPitaya:
  - Front-End design of a Superheterodyne Receiver chain with baseband range 0-50MHz (limited by RedPitaya's 125Msps sampling rate)
  - Enabling continuous data streaming from the RedPitaya's ADCs to a remote PC.
