# VSP2023

VSP at Raman Research Institute, summer 2023.

- Worked on two majors projects in the span, the SKA-LOW (150-350MHz) range Log Periodic Dipole Antenna (LPDA) interferometry array, and the Analog + Digital backend for a RedPitaya module for conducting wideband Horn observations for 21cm Galactic Hydrogen emissions.

- LPDA: (MATLAB and Python programs are available for all of the below*:)
      a. Python program for Data acquisition out of an Oscilloscope,
      b. Visualizing Solar and Galactic plane transits in the Radio spectrum.  
      c. Two element Interferometry for Solar Radio signals; observation of Fringe pattern. 

*Working on developing a GUI for the same

- RedPitaya:
      a. Front-End design of a Superheterodyne Receiver chain with baseband range 0-50MHz (limited by RedPitaya's 125Msps sampling rate)
     *b. Configuring Redpitaya's Hardware and enforcing Data reduction techniques within the ZYNQ FPGA to adhere to digital Baud rate enable lossless streaming into           a remote computer.
